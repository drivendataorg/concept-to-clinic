# Concept to Clinic Official Rules

Guidelines
----------

### One account per participant

All Participants must create or maintain an Account at GitHub.com,
execute a Contributor License Agreement, and follow all other processes
as set forth on the Competition Website prior to participation.
Participants may not log in and contribute to the Competition Repo from
multiple Accounts.

### Public dissemination of Contributions

All Contributions are made under the terms of an open source software
license pursuant to the Contributor License Agreement, and DrivenData
and the public generally have the right to publicly disseminate any
Contributions or models in accord with that license.

### Judging Contributions

Contributions will be judged and points will be awarded by a Technical
Panel. Prizes will be awarded and distributed on a schedule as set forth
on the Competition Website in the discretion of the Technical Panel. The
Technical Panel or DrivenData may make interim awards when deemed
appropriate.

### External data

External data – for example, DICOM imagery or pre-trained models – is
not allowed unless it is made available to the public under an open
source license compatible with the open source license selected for this
project and freely available to all contributors without the need to
execute any data usage agreements or other authorizations.

### SUBMISSIONS FROM MULTIPLE COMPETITORS

By submitting a Pull Request, you certify that you are the sole author
of those changes for the purpose of awarding points, unless other
committers are specifically listed in the commit history or in the
comment field that you fill in when opening the Pull Request. If there
are multiple Participants listed in a Pull Request, the default method
for dividing credit will be to split any points in equal shares to
included Participants, unless all listed Participants agree to a
different breakdown and manifest this agreement by each individual
communicating their assent to the specified division of points in
writing to DrivenData immediately upon submitting the Pull Request
either by e-mail or comments on the Pull Request itself.

FULL RULES
----------

These are the complete, official rules for the Competition (the
"**Competition Rules**") and incorporate by reference the contents
of the Competition Website as defined below.

The Competition will consist of developing and submitting Contributions
(each such submission, a "**Pull Request**") to an open source
software project (the "**Project**") the goal of which is to use machine
learning to develop a real-word software tool to aid clinicians in
catching lung cancer early enough to manage its impact on patients and
save lives. For the purposes of this Competition, "**Contribution**"
means any and all submissions to the Competition through the Competition
Website (as defined below) or otherwise, whether in the form of code,
comments, or other work product. DrivenData will produce a "**Design Document**," which describes the goals of the Project, the anticipated
Project structure, and necessary features of the Project.

By submitting a Pull Request or other Contribution or executing the
Contibutor License Agreement ("**CLA**") in this Competition, you are
agreeing to be bound by these Competition Rules which constitute a
binding agreement between you and DrivenData and, if applicable, any
rules and restrictions that may be imposed by the Competition Sponsor.

The Competition is hosted by DrivenData, Inc ("**DrivenData**). The
Competition will run according to the dates listed on the Competition
Website (the "**Competition Period**").

Each registered individual is referred to as a **Participant**. You may
only compete using a single, unique account registered on GitHub
(<https://www.github.com>), the online
code collaboration platform used to host the Project’s version control
repositories (the "**Competition Repos**"). Competing using more
than one account per individual is a breach of these Competition Rules
and DrivenData and the Competition Sponsor reserve the right to
disqualify any Participant who is found to breach these Competition
Rules.

### Eligibility

The Competition is open to all natural persons over the age of 18 at the
time of entry. Legal entities and organizations are not eligible for
entry. There is no purchase or donation necessary to enter the
Competition.

Officers, directors, employees and advisory board members (and their
immediate families and members of the same household) of the Competition
Sponsor, DrivenData, members of the Technical Panel (as defined below)
and their respective affiliates, subsidiaries, contractors, agents,
judges and advertising and promotion agencies are not eligible to
participate in the Competition.

You are not eligible to receive any Prize in the Competition if you are
a resident of a country designated by the United States Treasury’s
Office of Foreign Assets Control.

### Registration

If you meet the eligibility requirements and would like to participate,
then you must first complete the CLA signing process
at <https://concepttoclinic.drivendata.org/> (the "**Competition
Website**") and register an account on GitHub such that you can
submit pull requests to the Competition Repos within the Competition
Period. All Contributions must be received during the Competition Period
in order to be eligible for any consideration. All of the registration
information that you provide is collectively referred to as your
"Account".

You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for abiding by
your employer's policies regarding participation in the Competition.
DrivenData and Sponsor disclaim any and all liability or responsibility
for disputes arising between an employee and employer related to this
Competition.

Once you have completed the registration process, you will be provided
with access to the Data, if any, that you use to develop your
Contributions.

BY ENTERING THE COMPETITION YOU ACCEPT THE CONDITIONS STATED IN THESE
OFFICIAL RULES INCLUDING THE RULES ON THE COMPETITION WEBSITE AND THE
CLA, AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE DECISIONS OF THE JUDGES, SPONSOR AND
DRIVENDATA AND WARRANT THAT YOU ARE ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE
COMPETITION. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT ALL OF THESE OFFICIAL RULES, THEN
PLEASE DO NOT CONTRIBUTE TO THE COMPETITION. WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU PRINT
OUT A COPY OF THESE OFFICIAL RULES FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE.

### CONTRIBUTIONS

Each Contribution must be submitted in the form of a Pull Request opened
on the official Competition Repo (see
https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/). All
Contributions must be received during the Competition Period. By
submitting a Pull Request, you certify that you are the author of those
changes for the purpose of awarding points, unless other committers are
specifically listed in the commit history or in the comment field on the
Pull Request at the time it is opened.

All Contributions will be reviewed for quantitative and qualitative
suitability prior to inclusion in the Project. You acknowledge and agree
that such judgments are necessarily subjective in nature, and that
Contributions will be accepted and Pull Requests merged in the sole
discretion of DrivenData and its agents. DrivenData and its agents may
modify any Contributions as necessary or advisable, in their sole
discretion, to conform to code and testing standards, make those
Contributions compatible with other features of the Project, or
otherwise allow for its inclusion in the Project.

All Contributions will also be reviewed to confirm that the Participant
has executed the CLA, and reviewed for compatibility of open sources
licenses associated with any Contribution or associated dependency. All
Contributions that fail either review, in DrivenData’s sole discretion,
will be automatically rejected.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, all Contributions are subject
to acceptance into the Project in DrivenData’s sole discretion, and
DrivenData may accept or reject any Contribution for any reason or no
reason. Contributions will not necessarily be reviewed in the order they
are submitted, but will instead be reviewed during the Competition
Period in order of priority, as determined in DrivenData’s sole
discretion, and there is no guarantee that any particular Contribution
will be reviewed during the Competition Period.

USER CONTRIBUTIONS MUST IN THEIR ENTIRETY COMPLY WITH ALL APPLICABLE
FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, AND INTERNATIONAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. WITHOUT
LIMITING THE FOREGOING, IN ORDER TO BE ELIGIBLE, YOU WARRANT THAT YOUR
CONTRIBUTION FOR THIS COMPETITION:

-   Does not include or anticipate the inclusion of any content that is
    in violation of or infringes third party intellectual property
    rights including, but not limited to copyrights, including music

    or privacy, or incompatible open source licenses.

-   Is free and clear of all liens, claims, encumbrances or demands of
    any third parties.

-   Does not include or anticipate the inclusion of any unsuitable or
    offensive content, including nudity, sexually explicit, disparaging,
    libelous or other inappropriate content.

-   Is suitable for a general audience.

-   Does not contain any claims that are not and cannot be substantiated
    or that would be false and/or misleading to a reasonable consumer.

-   Does not violate the project’s Code of
    Conduct at <http://concepttoclinic.drivendata.org/code-of-conduct/>.

### JUDGING CONTRIBUTIONS – AWARDING OF POINTS

This Competition is a challenge of skill and the final results are
determined by evaluating a combination of quantitative and qualitative
factors, as more fully described on the Competition Website. As a
general matter, each Contribution will be eligible for an award of
points (the "**Points**") as recommended by DrivenData and its agents
and reviewed and approved by a panel of technical experts (the
"**Technical Panel**"). Points may be awarded for Contributions that
solve a specific technical issue or implement a particular feature (each
an "**Issue**") called out in the Design Document or otherwise set forth
on the Competition Website ("**Issue Points**"). The number of
Points to be awarded for resolution of any Issue will be set forth on
the Competition Website, and partial Points or Points divided amongst
several contributors may be awarded in the discretion of DrivenData and
the Technical Panel.

Points may also be awarded on an entirely discretionary basis for
Contributions that do not resolve a pre-determined Issue but are
nevertheless meaningful to the Project ("**Discretionary Points**").
Where small amounts of Discretionary Points are being awarded for a
particular Contribution, as specified on the Competition Website,
DrivenData or its agents may make that award entirely in its own
discretion. Where larger amounts of Discretionary Points are being
awarded for a particular Contribution, those points will be awarded as
recommended by DrivenData and its agents and reviewed and approved by
the Technical Panel. The value and timing of Discretionary Points will
be entirely within the discretion of DrivenData and the Technical Panel.

Points awarded will be tracked and displayed on the Competition Website
once approved. At the end of the challenge or at specified intervals
during the challenge, Points will be tallied and monetary prizes will be
awarded, as more fully described on the Competition Website. Available
monetary prizes will be as set forth on the Competition Website.
DrivenData may also award such non-monetary prizes as it determines in
its sole discretion are suitable for the purpose of recognizing small,
innovative, unexpected, or otherwise deserving Contributions. All
monetary and non-monetary awards hereunder are referred to as
"**Prizes**."

Any Prize awards are subject to verification of eligibility and
compliance with these Competition Rules. All decisions of DrivenData,
the Competition Sponsor and/or the Technical Panel will be final and
binding on all matters relating to this Competition. DrivenData reserves
the right (1) to examine the Contribution and any associated code or
documentation for compliance with these Competition Rules, and (2) to
request supporting documentation from Contributors regarding their
Accounts and Contributions for determining compliance with these
Competition Rules. In the event that the Contribution demonstrates a
breach of these Competition Rules, Competition Sponsor or DrivenData may
at its discretion take either of the following actions:

-   **disqualify your Contribution(s)**; or 

-   require that you remediate within one week all issues identified in
    your Contribution(s) (including, without limitation, the resolution
    of license conflicts, the fulfillment of all obligations required by
    software licenses, and the removal of any software that violates the
    software restrictions).

You may decline to receive any Prize by notifying DrivenData directly
within one week following the Prize notification, in which case you
forego any Prize or other features associated with an awarded
Contribution.

### Prizes and conditions

If you are awarded a Prize, you will be notified and announced within 30
days of the award on the Competition Website. You will receive monetary
prizes as a check or wire transfer from DrivenData, and non-monetary
prizes will be mailed. You agree to provide such information as is
necessary for the transmission of all Prizes.

If there are multiple Participants listed in a Pull Request (either in
the commit history or comments), the default will be to split points in
equal shares to included Participants, unless all listed Participants
agree to a different breakdown and communicate that breakdown in writing
to DrivenData by email or in comments to the Pull Request immediately
upon submission.

The Prize may be awarded to an alternate winner if required
documentation is not returned within thirty (30) days after mailing to
you, if the Prize notification letter/email or Prize is returned as
undeliverable, or if you do not respond to an email or other
communication from DrivenData within ten (10) days of the date sent.
Allow thirty (30) days for Prize delivery. By accepting any Prize, you
agree to allow DrivenData and/or the Competition Sponsor to disclose
your first name, first initial of last name, and city of residence, as
well as Prize information to the extent required by law, and if so
required by law, you agree to the disclosure of additional personal
information, all without additional compensation.

DrivenData is responsible only for Prize delivery and is not responsible
for Prize utility or otherwise. No substitution or transfer of Prizes is
permitted. All taxes, fees and expenses associated with participation in
the Competition or receipt and use of a Prize are your sole
responsibility.

### PARTICIPANT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LICENSING

As a further condition of participation in the Competition, you agree to
execute the CLA. The CLA is expressly incorporated herein and made a
part hereof. You specifically represent and warrant by entering the
Competition and executing the CLA that you have the unrestricted right
to grant the license contemplated thereby.

### CHEATING

DrivenData reserves the right to request information associated with our
investigation of suspected cheating of any form. Failure to respond to
these requests (including failure to furnish the requested information)
within ten (10) days is grounds for disqualification.

Cheating of any kind, including incorporation of others’ work product or
intellectual property into Contributions without proper attribution,
participating using more than one Account, or otherwise, will result in
disqualification from the Competition and any other affected
Competitions and may result in banning or deactivation of affected
Accounts.

### PERMISSIONS

Except where prohibited by law, entry constitutes permission to use your
name, hometown and likeness for online posting, and/or any advertising
and publicity associated with the Competition without additional
compensation. If you are awarded a Prize, you may also be required to
sign and return a release of liability, declaration of eligibility and,
where lawful, a publicity consent agreement, as conditions of receiving
that prize. Failure to comply with the aforementioned conditions shall
be grounds for forfeiture of a Prize. If you are awarded an in-kind prize
from a Competition sponsor, you give permission for the Company to share
your contact information with the sponsor in order to receive the prize.

### Data use and code sharing

-   **DATA**
    
    "Data" means the data or datasets linked from the Competition Website

    prototype or executable code provided to you by DrivenData via the
    Competition Website. You must use the Data only as permitted by these
    Competition Rules and any associated data use rules specified on the
    Competition Website.
    
    Unless otherwise permitted by the terms of the Competition Website, you
    must use the Data solely for the purpose and duration of the
    Competition, including but not limited to reading and learning from the
    Data, analyzing the Data, modifying the Data and generally preparing
    your Contributions and any underlying models and participating in forum
    discussions on the Competition Website. You agree to use suitable
    measures to prevent persons who have not formally agreed to these
    Competition Rules from gaining access to the Data and agree not to
    transmit, duplicate, publish, redistribute or otherwise provide or make
    available the Data to any party not participating in the Competition.
    You agree to notify DrivenData immediately upon learning of any possible
    unauthorized transmission or unauthorized access of the Data and agree
    to work with DrivenData to rectify any unauthorized transmission. You

    or otherwise) under, or any right of ownership in, any of the Data.

-   **EXTERNAL DATA**
    
    Unless otherwise expressly stated on the Competition Website, you must
    not use data other than the Data to develop and test your models and
    Contributions, unless data used is made available to the public under an
    open source license compatible with the open source license selected for
    this project and freely available to all contributors without the need
    to execute any data usage agreements or other authorizations. DrivenData
    and the Competition Sponsor reserve the right in their sole discretion
    to disqualify you if it is discovered that you have undertaken or
    attempted to undertake the use of the Data or external data other than
    as permitted according to the Competition Website and in these
    Competition Rules, in the course of the Competition.

-   **OPEN-SOURCE CODE**
    
    A Submission will be ineligible to win a prize if it was developed using
    code containing or depending on software licensed under an open source
    license:

    *   other than an Open Source Initiative-approved license (see <http://opensource.org/>);
    
    *   an open source license incompatible, in the discretion of
        DrivenData, with the Project license or the Contributor License
        Agreement; or
    
    *   an open source license that prohibits commercial use.
