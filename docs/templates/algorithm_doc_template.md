<!-- NOTE: The tables are created using reST markup syntax inside of a markdown file.
Ensure that your table data fits correctly so that your table is displayed. You
can reference this site(https://thomas-cokelaer.info/tutorials/sphinx/rest_syntax.html#tables)
or look at existing algorithm files for cases like long lines and how you can wrap
them in rows to avoid long text lines. -->
